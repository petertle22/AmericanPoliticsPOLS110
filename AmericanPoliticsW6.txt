Quiz on the constitution (chaptres 3-5) and provisions of constitution

What is self-evident truth of human equality?
  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
   that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness"

consent, popular sovereing and equality are related
explain the concept and provide specific examples
  Consent: I must have a say in how i am governed => voting, right to revolution, 
  Right to revolution: whenever life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, we can overthrow the government
  Prudence: pratical wisdom we do not resolve the government if we do not agree => only can overthrow if there is a long history of abuse

Popular Sovereignty: the principle that the authority of a state and its government
are created and sustained by the consent of its people, who are the source of the political power

Equality: 
1. Exclusivist -> Roger B. Taney all white, property owning men are equal
2. Historicist -> Carl Becker says no universal truth to history, truth is relative to the time
3. Universal -> Jefferson, Lincoln, MLK applies to all human beings 

We talked about the reconliation of liberty, authroty, energy and power, 

Strong government but free government
If too string but not sufficiently limitedleads to tyranny

Weak government taht allows ot meuch freedom and not enought ot enfource the law => mobocracy and chaos

Striking a balance between tyranny and orcahny => check and balances => each branch can control stuff on other branches
Need a government that is strong to hold control itself and must enable itself.
The strength of government also ensures liberty

Federalist, 9 => Hamilton (The constitution slide 4)
Empower and limit the government by restraining its sphere of operation

Regular distribution ofpower into distinct departments => the executive branch, judicial, and legisalure
The Supreme court can exercise judicial review and we have bicameral house => Both must pass a law
The president may veto a law.

An inpdependt judiciary cannot reflect the impulse of the people and be impartial => representatives which is why they serve for life 

Article 1 section 8, line 17: Elastic/Necessary & Proper Clause

Article 1 section 1, 1-17: legistalitve branch=> power is granted inot Congress which has a senate and house
435 members in house EXAM seats are based on population
Population of each district is about 720,000

Article 2 section 1: executive enforces the law (the articles had this but he didn't do anyting)

Article 3 section 1: judiciary: law judging by the supreem court

Madison considersall powers legistalitve, executive, and judiciary in the same hands is tyryanny.

Exam:
The separation of power is not absolute, but shared and mixed
Branches have primary powers: Articles I, II, III
Power is interconnnected, interpenetraing & Defense
Check and balances - Power used to off-set Power
Example: President can veto (article 1), supreme court can strike unconstituional (judicial review)
Marbury vs Madison (1803) established judicial review
executive orders -> a declaration by the president or a governor which manages operations of the federal government
2/3 Supermajority override

Madison says the greatest security against graduate concentration of powers 
"Ambition must be made to counteract ambition" Madison in Federalist 51 => they expect people in gaovernment to be self fish
and pursue for their own interest => individuals are going to expand their own power, so the branches have tension with each other
-> Constituion slide 11 => harnessing self-interset for each branch will pit the government against itself
Example: bicameral house, judicial review, the house indicts the president but senate must vote 2/3 majority to remove president from office
Congress decides the size of the court, but the president appoints the judges

Enumerated/Expressed/Delegated Powers: (The constiiton slide 13)
Article 1 section 8, 1-17: Power assigned to legislature 
Congress can collect taxes, borrow money, regulate commerce with foreign nations, coin money, declare war, raise army, and navy


Separation of power articles 1,2,3

Congress will short the declaration of war but tells president to work => congress evades responsiliblity
War has been declared 5 times but Congress has allowed the use of military use
Gulf of tonkin resolution
1. War of 1812
2. Mexican American War
3. Spanish American War
4. World War 1
5. World War 2
Authorization use of military force: Congress allows the president to use the military force.
Korea was a UN => peace action of the UN

What is an example of implied powers? the elastic clause
Implied powers / Elastic powers & Necessary and Proper Clause (Article 1 section 8, 17)
Provides flexibility in carrying out enumeated powers

Battle over the bank was is an example of Congress's implied powers. 
Loose/Braod vs Strict/Narrow Construction

Loowse/Broad Construction: the federal govenment is given broad discretion on carying out its enumerated powers
Strict/Narrow Construction: the federal government is strictly restricted to what they granted in the constitution. All discretionary authority lies in the states. 

Whether or not congress can create a national bank => constituition did not say if they can make a national bank
Jefferson said no BC the constiiton did not say => Jefferson said it is only necessary when it's the absolute last resort
Hamilton said we need a national bank to carry out its enumerated power of taxes and coining money => as a consequence the implied and Elastic power allows it => it is convenient

Hamilton was re-affirmed McCulloch Vs Maryland, 1819 => secured Hamilton's Provide
the state government cannot tax the federal government

Jefferson said taht all powers not deleated to the US, nor prohibited by it to the states
they are limited to what the constition said and that's it => Jefferson arggued Necessary and proper does not mean convenient
